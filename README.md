Manage your backups from the cloud

Written using Python, this web application will connect to backup agents on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS).  It will also connect to storage agents located on or near storage solutions (NAS, DAS, SAN, Samba, NFS, etc).  It will host schedules and initiate builds between client agents (things to be backed up) and storage agents (places to backup).

Backup reports will be stored in this tool, and can be viewed online or emailed at the completion of backups (successful or not).
